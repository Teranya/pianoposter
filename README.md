# PianoPoster

A P5.JS sketch that uses capactive touch input from an Arduino and uses the sensor data to play audio using p5.sound, the sketch library also uses  p5.sound's FFT and P5.scribble to create visualisations for the audio being played.

The arduino is connected to a board with keys made of conductive paint, touching a painted key plays a tone. There are a total of 11 tones, 7 use SFX crystal sounds and 4 use glockenspiel sounds.
